# Word-Guess-Game / Hangman

## About the game
* This is a slightly different version of the traditional Hangman game.
* I have used Spaceman as my character and he is in outer space searching for the correct country to land on.
* You have to guess the correct country word.
* At the end of each round you will get more information about the country.
* The number of Wins increases for every correct country guessed.
* The number of Losses increases for every wrong country guessed.
* There is no end to the game.
* Keep playing until you get tired.
* Hope you enjoy my game and learn something new today!

## Actions
1. Press any alphabet keys to guess the letters in the country word which is diplayed in the form of dashes.
2. If you press any key other than the alphabets, then there will be no action performed.
3. If you press the same alphabet again, then it will not perform any action and not reduce your guesses.
4. Having the caps lock on will not affect the game play.

## Rules
1. You win when you guess the complete word before you exhaust all 10 guesses or before the Spaceman explodes.
2. You lose when you exhaust all 10 guesses or the Spaceman explodes.
