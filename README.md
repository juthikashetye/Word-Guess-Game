# Word-Guess-Game / Hangman

## About the game
* This is a slightly different version of the traditional Hangman game.
* I have used Spaceman as my character and he is in outer space searching for the correct country to land on.
* Although the content of the game is responsive, the game can only be played on devices with a keyboard.
* Hope you enjoy my game and learn something new today!

## Actions
1. Press any alphabet keys to guess the letters in the country word which is diplayed in the form of dashes.
2. If you press any key other than the alphabets, then there will be no action performed.
3. If you press the same alphabet again, then it will not perform any action and not reduce your guesses.
4. Having the caps lock on will not affect the game play.

## Rules
1. You have to guess the correct country word.
2. You win when you guess the complete word before you exhaust all 10 guesses or before the Spaceman explodes.
3. The number of Wins increases for every correct country guessed.
4. You lose when you exhaust all 10 guesses or the Spaceman explodes.
5. The number of Losses increases for every wrong country guessed.
6. At the end of each round you will get more information about the country.
7. There is no end to the game.
8. Keep playing until you get tired.
